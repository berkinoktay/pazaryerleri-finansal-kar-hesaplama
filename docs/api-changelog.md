# API Changelog

All notable changes to the PazarSync REST API.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this API follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) within each URL
path version (`/v1/`, `/v2/`, …). The major number of `info.version` is locked
to the URL path version. While the API is internal-only, breaking changes
within `/v1/` bump minor — see `docs/plans/2026-04-16-api-docs-design.md`
section "Versioning" for details.
